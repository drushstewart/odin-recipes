    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It should surprise no one that escargot comes from France. Escargot is the French word for snails, so seeing that word on a menu does refer to the French preparation of snails, which is the one in this escargot recipe.</p>
    <p>However, snails are eaten in other parts of the world aside from France. It is not uncommon to find snails in other parts of Europe (such as Spain), Southeast Asia, and even in African countries.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, throughout most of history snails were considered a 'poor man's food' not to be served in fine dining. However, due to the growing popularity of French cooking as the 'mother cuisine,' chefs brought snails or escargot to the mainstream, even bringing them to now be considered a delicacy.</p>
