    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We came up with this recipe while brainstorming how to make a pasta dish for two, and landed on lasagna because it's the ultimate crowd-pleaser, the king of all baked pastas, the most impressive thing we could think of. We are not ashamed to admit that the idea for presenting it this way came from a photo of baked cinnamon buns in a pan, though we later learned that there is in fact a classic, pinwheel shaped pasta dish that exists in Italy, called rotolo.</p>
    <p>We wanted to make this version taste like classic lasagna and pulled in all the flavors of a true lasagna Bolognese — fresh pasta, besciamella, Bolognese sauce — and added some Italian American twists of our own (i.e. mozzarella, tomato sauce, sweet Italian sausage). It's perfect for sharing, because each person gets a pinwheel, and the whole top is crispy, so every bite is perfect. The lasagna is lighter than most traditional lasagnas because we use robiola cheese instead of ricotta cheese. The pinwheels are easy to share, and they are fun to make.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta</li>
            <li>Béchamel</li>
            <li>Bolognese</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400°F.</li>
            <li>Lay out a pasta sheet on a clean countertop. Spread a thin layer of béchamel evenly across the pasta sheet.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle parmesan and mozzarella over the béchamel. Place another sheet of pasta on top. Spread a layer of Bolognese evenly across the second pasta sheet, leaving one edge uncovered with sauce in order to seal the roll closed. Roll the layered pasta into a log. Place in refrigerator to cool.</li>
            <li>When cool, slice the lasagna log into pinwheels. Ladle the tomato sauce into a casserole to cover the entire bottom of the dish. Lay lasagna pinwheels into the casserole dish, with the cut sides facing up, until the dish is full. Add dollops of robiola cheese in between the pinwheels.</li>
            <li>Place in the oven and and bake for about fifteen minutes or until pasta edges are golden brown. Top with chopped parsley and serve.</li>
        </ol>
